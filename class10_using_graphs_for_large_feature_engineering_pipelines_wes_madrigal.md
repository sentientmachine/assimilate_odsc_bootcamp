# BIG INSIGHT

google colab can consume an ipynb from github and everything just works to produce real time run time for models.  See
Step 1:
● In your browser go to google collab: ● http://colab.research.google.com/
Example one:
● New notebook
● Click File, Upload Notebook, Github
● Enter this link:
https://github.com/wesmadrigal/GraphReduce/blob/master/examples/ODSC_East_2024 _ex1.ipynb
Example two:
● New notebook
● Click File, Upload Notebook, Github
● Enter this link:
https://github.com/wesmadrigal/GraphReduce/blob/master/examples/ODSC_East_2024 _ex2.ipynb
Example three:
● New notebook
● Click File, Upload Notebook, Github
● Enter this link:
https://github.com/wesmadrigal/GraphReduce/blob/master/examples/ODSC_East_2024 _ex3.ipynb
Example four (if time):
● New notebook
● Click File, Upload Notebook, Github
● Enter this link:
● https://github.com/wesmadrigal/GraphReduce/blob/master/examples/ODSC_East_2024
_ex4.ipynb
