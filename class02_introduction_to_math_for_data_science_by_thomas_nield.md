With the availability of data, there is a growing demand for talent who can analyze and make sense of it. This makes practical math all the more important because it helps infer insights from data. However, mathematics comprises many topics, and it is hard to identify which ones are applicable and relevant for a data science career. Knowing these essential math topics is key to integrating knowledge across data science, statistics, and machine learning. It has become even more important with the prevalance of libraries like PyTorch and scikit-learn, which can create """"black box"""" approaches where data science professionals use these libraries but do not fully understand how they work.

In this training, Thomas Nield (author of O'Reilly book """"Essential Math for Data Science"""") will provide a crash-course of carefully curated topics to jumpstart proficiency in key areas of mathematics. This includes probability, statistics, hypothesis testing, and linear algebra. Along the way you’ll integrate what you’ve learned and see practical applications for real-world problems. These examples include how statistical concepts apply to machine learning, and how linear algebra is used to fit a linear regression. We will also use Python to explore ideas in calculus and model-fitting, using a combination of libraries and from-scratch approaches.
