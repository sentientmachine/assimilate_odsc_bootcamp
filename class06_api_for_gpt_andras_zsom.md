Tools/Languages utilized: Python, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas
Prerequisites Please run test_environment.ipynb. It checks the versions of your python and some packages (like pandas, openai). If the notebook returns all OK, you should be able to run the code without issues. If some FAILs are returned, you need to install/update those packages first.

You can recreate the python environment using the dscov-chatgpt.yml conda environment file by running these two commands in the terminal:
conda env create -n dscov-chatgpt -f dscov-chatgpt.yml
conda activate dscov-chatgpt

You should be able to run src/DSCoV - ChatGPT API.ipynb now.
